# HydroHarmony: Smart Irrigation and Fertilization Using Machine Learning

## Overview

HydroHarmony is a state-of-the-art system designed to revolutionize irrigation and fertilization management in agriculture through the use of advanced machine learning techniques. The system leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and Random Forest algorithms to optimize water and fertilizer distribution, ensuring precise decision-making that maximizes crop yield and minimizes resource waste.

By incorporating real-time monitoring of moisture content, rainfall, and weather forecasts, HydroHarmony allows for proactive adjustments in irrigation schedules and fertilization plans tailored to the specific needs of each crop and environmental condition. The system's predictive models dynamically control irrigation valves, optimizing water distribution based on real-time data inputs.

## Features

- **Precision Agriculture**: Integrates SVM and Random Forest algorithms to achieve high accuracy in irrigation and fertilization management.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors soil moisture, weather conditions, and other critical parameters to adjust irrigation and fertilization strategies on the fly.
- **Automated Irrigation**: Dynamically controls irrigation valves based on predictive models, reducing water consumption and ensuring efficient resource use.
- **Smart Farm Application**: Provides farmers with actionable insights through an intuitive interface, enabling informed decision-making for improved agricultural productivity.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Minimizes water waste and optimizes fertilizer use, contributing to sustainable farming practices.
